# graphrel

A simple, WYSIWYG relation-based graph editor powered by d3.

Not only useful for modeling/analyzing real-world relations, but also serves as a pedagogical tool for anybody 
learning about graphs.

Currently supports synchronous graph/adjacency list editing. May add relation characteristics and file IO 
capabilities soon.

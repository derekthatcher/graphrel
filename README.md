# graphrel

A simple, intuitive graph editor/explorer/analyzer powered by d3.

Great for learners of graph theory; also useful for modeling/analyzing real-world relations.

Currently supports WYSIWYG editing, linear undo/redo, file IO via adjacency list, and graph/relational property analysis. More features coming soon.
